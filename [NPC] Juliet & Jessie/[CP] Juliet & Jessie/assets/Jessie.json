Ugh!$3\"/pause 500/speak Jessie \"No kissing required, promise!$1#$b#But other love: the kind you show with hugs, and smiles. With kind words and fun games, and stories.\"/pause 500/speak Vincent \"Oh! But I'm doing that already.$3#$b#And it's not making him better.$2\"/pause 500/speak Jessie \"There's another special ingredient.

And he still loves you a lot.\"/pause 500/speak Vincent \"I know... Mom says the same thing.$2#$b#Thanks Miss Jessie. Will you come, sit with me sometimes?\"/speak Jessie \"Of course I will, Vincent.\"/pause 500/jump Vincent 4/speak Vincent \"Hey, I've had a great idea!
